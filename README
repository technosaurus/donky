This contains: 1) Summary  2) Getting started

[1) SUMMARY]
LOOKS LIKE WE NEED TO UPDATE THIS.

[2) Getting Started]
Start off by running `./autogen.sh`, followed by `make install`.

A default configuration will be installed in your configuration 
directory (usually /usr/local/etc), under the sub-directory 'donky', 
file named 'donky.conf'.  Copy this to your home directory as ~/.donkyrc 
or edit in its place for a global configuration.
