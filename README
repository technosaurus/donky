donky: A minimal, modular system monitor daemon.

This contains: 1) Summary  2) Getting started

1. Summary

        Inspired originally to create a conky clone, donky has recently evolved
        into a modular system monitor daemon.  This was brought on by a radical
        IRC conversation between the creators.  Being a daemon with a simple
        to use protocol allows for a variety of different front-ends to be
        built, not to mention the practical applications of monitoring remote
        machines or a cluster of boxes in your local area network.

2. Getting started

        Start off by running `./autogen.sh`, followed by `./configure`, followed
        by `make install`.  You can fine tune what modules you would like to be
        built by adding `--enable-module` for whatever module you wish.
        To see a list run `./configure --help`.

        A default configuration will be installed in your configuration 
        directory (usually /usr/local/etc), under the sub-directory 'donky', 
        file named 'donky.conf'.  Copy this to your home directory as ~/.donkyrc 
        or edit in its place for a global configuration.
