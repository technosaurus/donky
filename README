donky: A minimal, modular X11 system monitor intended to destroy conky.

This contains: 1) Summary  2) Getting started

[1) SUMMARY]
We are a couple of dewds who started writing patches for conky, only to 
find that conky is pretty much a terrible code base that obviously was 
designed with no intention of easily expanding it.  Put on top of that 
the inefficiencies in redrawing an entire display of text based on a 
global timeout.  donky has been designed from the ground up for 
developers and end users to be infinitely expandable.  This is done 
through a dynamically linked module system.  Variables can be configured 
on an individual basis to accept different timeouts based on user 
preference.  An example might be that you only want your current MPD 
song display updated every 20 seconds, while you might want your time 
display updated every 1 second.

donky is under heavy development, so we would not be in the least 
surprised if this doesn't even compile on your system.  No tests have 
been done outside of the Arch Linux distribution and the configure 
scripts are extremely minimal, meaning that if you do not have certain 
libraries installed, even for "optional" modules, you will not be able 
to compile without modifying a few autoconf configuration files.

[2) Getting Started]
Start off by running `./autogen.sh`, followed by `make install`.

A default configuration will be installed in your configuration 
directory (usually /usr/local/etc), under the sub-directory 'donky', 
file named 'donky.conf'.  Copy this to your home directory as ~/.donkyrc 
or edit in its place for a global configuration.
